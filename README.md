*Do a particular hotel's amenities impact user ratings? and if yes can we predict user ratings based on these amenities?* 

In this project we analyze the publicly available [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Las+Vegas+Strip) of Las Vegas strip hotels and see if there is a relationship between different hotel features and user scores. Detailed project proposal can be found [here](/docs/Proposal.md). 

This is a live README document and will be updated on completion of different project milestones. As of now initial data exploration has been performed on the dataset and  the markdown document corresponding to the analysis can be found [here](/docs/EDA_vegas_strip_data.md).
