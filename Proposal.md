The Dataset chosen for the research project is the “Las Vegas Strip Dataset” which is a collated information about customer feedback on 21 Hotels located in the Las Vegas Strip. The data is extracted from popular and well-regarded travel portal “TripAdvisor”. 
 -Moro, S., Rita, P., & Coelho, J. (2017). Stripping customers' feedback on hotels through data mining: The case of Las Vegas Strip. Tourism Management Perspectives, 23, 41-52.

### Research Question:
1.Do Hotel amenities have an impact on their customer ratings.
2.Can we predict an average rating for a hotel based on the amenities provided to the guests.

We plan to use the dataset and implement a Linear regression model or/and a Generalized linear model get predictions for the ratings of the hotel between values of 1 and 5.

We intend to use ggpairs to analyse the data and produce the plots that illustrate the relations between the key features of the model and the response variable.

The results of the research findings are to be shared using figures and tables such as Mean Square Error, R- Square and Residual plots.
