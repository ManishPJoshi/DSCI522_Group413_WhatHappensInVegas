# Summary

Here we attempt to build a linear regression model which can use data about the hotel amenities and predict what kind of user ratings can be expected for the hotel given these amenities are functional in the hotel.  Exploratory data analysis was performed in R and only on the training data. Different hotel specific features were checked against the ratings given to the hotel by the users. From the preliminary EDA it became apparent that some features do not have much impact on the hotel ratings whereas certain features such as the presence of a Swim pool and wifi internet had a positive impact on the hotel ratings.


# Introduction

Most travel and hotel bookings are nowadays being made online and one of the key parameters a potential consumer refers to before deciding on which hotel to book is the ratings given to a hotel by the previous users. For this project we are trying to answer the question: Given the presence of certain amenities in a hotel what is the expected average user rating for that hotel? Tourism industry professionals, travel agents, investors and Hotel owners who wish to attract clients can draw benefit from such a model. 

# Methods

## Data

The Dataset chosen for the research project is the “Las Vegas Strip Dataset” which is a collated information about customer feedback on 21 Hotels located in the Las Vegas Strip. The data is extracted from popular, respected and well-regarded travel portal “TripAdvisor”. 
-Moro, S., Rita, P., & Coelho, J. (2017). Stripping customers' feedback on hotels through data mining: The case of Las Vegas Strip. Tourism Management Perspectives, 23, 41-52. 
It was sourced from the UCI machine learning repositories and can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Las+Vegas+Strip). Each row in the data set represents information about the amenities present in the hotel such as swimming pool, spa, wifi and other contextual data and the user rating for the hotel.


## Analysis

From the preliminary EDA it became apparent that some features do not have much impact on the hotel ratings whereas certain features such as the presence of a Swim pool and wifi internet had a positive impact on the hotel ratings. 

```{r}

```


The training of the model was done in Python. The model performed poorly with a high Mean Square Error when all the features were used in the training dataset. Linear regression (weights) values were used to determine the important features and the rest of the features were removed to train data.
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Figure 2. Realation between number of features and validation error", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../results/result_features.png")

```


The features which had a significant impact on the user scores were 1. Swimming pool, 2.Free Wifi Internet and the Visitor's continent. These metrics were in line with what was seen during the EDA stage.

The Model was then trained with a different regression algorithms such as 1. linear regression 2. RFregressor 3. Lasso 4. ridge regression and 5. SVM. from sklearn package in Python. A 10- fold cross validation was used to determine the best hyperparameters. It was found that the best performing algorithm on the validation set was the ridge regression(regularized Liner regression) and this was chosen as the final model.


# Results

- Results of the fitting model are as shown below. The error metric used is MSE (mean square error)

- The final error obtained on the unseen test data is 0.867 which is similar to the training error obtained. The model generalizes well and does not overfit.
